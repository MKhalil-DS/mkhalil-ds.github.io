Project for predicting five key polymer properties (glass transition temperature, fractional free volume, thermal conductivity, polymer density, and radius of gyration) based on the polymer's molecular structure, expressed using the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES). This was part of the Kaggle competition ["NeurIPS - Open Polymer Prediction 2025"](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/neurips-open-polymer-prediction-2025/).
