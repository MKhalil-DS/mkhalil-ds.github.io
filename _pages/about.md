I am a data scientist and researcher with over eight years of experience in modeling physical systems based on observational data, simulations and analytical calculations. My research focus has been on gravitational-wave physics, where the models I developed are widely used by the Nobel Prize-winning LIGO Scientific Collaboration to analyze gravitational-wave signals. My contributions have directly supported the detection and characterization of numerous gravitational-wave events, enhancing our understanding of the universe.

I earned my BSc in Electrical Engineering from Alexandria University before pursuing a PhD in Physics, which I completed in 2022 through a joint program between the University of Maryland in the US and the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Germany. Following my PhD, I joined the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics as a postdoctoral researcher. 

My research resulted in 29 peer-reviewed [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=eukGPR4AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) in prestigious journals, including Physical Review Letters and Physical Review D. I also presented my findings at 10 international conferences and 5 invited seminars. For my research, I received the [Charles W. Misner](https://www.aei.mpg.de/707456/charles-w) Award from the University of Maryland and the [Otto Hahn Medal](https://www.aei.mpg.de/1163445/otto-hahn-medal-for-mohammed-khalil) from the Max Planck Society.
