## Rocket landing prediction using machine learning

Project on using machine learning to predict if the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully. The project involved the following:

- Data collection from SpaceX API and web scrapping from Wikipedia.
- Exploratory data analysis using visualization and SQL.
- Interactive visual analytics using Folium and Dash.
- Predictive analysis using several machine learning classification algorithms.

This is my solution for the [IBM Applied Data Science Capstone project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone) on Coursera. For more details, see the [presentation](/files/rocket_landing.pdf), or the Jupyter Notebooks on [github](https://github.com/MKhalil-DS/coursera-projects/tree/main/capstone_DS_SpaceX).

## Online course recommender system

Project on building recommender systems for online courses. The project involved the following:

- Exploratory data analysis
- Content-based recommender system using unsupervised learning (k-means and PCA)
- Collaborative-filtering recommender system using supervised learning (KNN, non-negative matrix, and neural networks)

This is my solution for the [IBM Machine Learning Capstone project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-capstone) on Coursera. For more details, see the [presentation](/files/course_recommender.pdf), or the Jupyter Notebooks on [github](https://github.com/MKhalil-DS/coursera-projects/tree/main/capstone_ML_recommender).

## Comparison of neural network models for digit recognition

Project for comparing a few neural network architectures for digit recognition (using the standard MINST dataset). I compared the following models: 
- Single-layer network using the MLPClassifier from scikit-learn
- Two-layer network using Keras
- Convolutional neural network

This was created as the final project for the IBM course ["Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-learning-reinforcement-learning). For more details, see the [report](/files/report_digits_MNIST.pdf), or the Jupyter Notebook on [github](https://github.com/MKhalil-DS/coursera-projects/tree/main/digits-MNIST).

## Comparison of classification algorithms

Project for comparing some supervised machine learning algorithms for classification (logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor, decision trees, and random forest), applied to the problem of classifying tumors.
Additionally, a comparison is performed of some unsupervised machine learning algorithms (K-means, agglomerative hierarchical clustering, mean shift, and HDBSCAN), applied to synthetic data.

This was created as the final project for the IBM courses ["Supervised Machine Learning: Classification"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/supervised-machine-learning-classification?specialization=ibm-machine-learning) and ["Unsupervised Machine Learning"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ibm-unsupervised-machine-learning?specialization=ibm-machine-learning) on Coursera. For more details, see the Jupyter Notebooks on [github](https://github.com/MKhalil-DS/coursera-projects/tree/main/classification_algorithms).
